'''
Variable names can contain letters, numbers, or underscores
But they cannot start with a number
Can only start with a letter or underscore

# Here we go

x = 5
y = 10
# x = y
y = x

print ('x = ', x)
print ('y = ', y)

# Operator examples
a, b = 5, 2

# Basic operators
# addition
print (a + b)
# subtraction
print (a - b)
# multiplication
print (a * b)
# division
print (a / b)
# floor division (rounds down to the nearest whole number)
print (a // b)
# modulus (gives the remainder)
print (a % b)
# exponent
print (a ** b)

# Even more operators!
c = 10
# c = c + 2 can be rewritten as:
c += 2
print (c)
c -= 2
print (c)
